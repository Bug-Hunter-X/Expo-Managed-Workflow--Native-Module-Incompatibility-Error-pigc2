# Expo Managed Workflow Native Module Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo's managed workflow with third-party libraries that rely on native modules.  The example shows how such libraries can lead to runtime errors or build failures if not properly configured or handled.

## Problem

Many libraries require direct access to native modules for functionality (e.g., camera access, Bluetooth communication).  Expo's managed workflow, designed for simplicity, encapsulates native modules, preventing direct access unless specific strategies are employed.  Attempting to use these libraries directly can lead to errors.

## Solution

There are several solutions:

1. **Use an Expo-compatible alternative:** Often, there are alternatives specifically designed for the Expo managed workflow that avoid the need for native module access.
2. **Switch to Expo's bare workflow:** This gives full access to native modules, but requires more complex setup and configuration.
3. **Use an appropriate wrapper/bridge:** Some libraries offer Expo-compatible wrappers or provide mechanisms to bridge the gap between managed and native code.

This example showcases a common error and its resolution, highlighting the importance of checking library compatibility with the chosen Expo workflow.
