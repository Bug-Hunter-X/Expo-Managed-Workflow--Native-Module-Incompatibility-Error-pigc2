This error occurs when using the Expo managed workflow and attempting to use a library that requires native modules without properly configuring it for the Expo environment.  Expo's managed workflow encapsulates the native code, and libraries expecting direct native module access can cause unexpected behavior.  The error may manifest as a runtime error, a build failure, or simply the feature of the library not functioning correctly.  The library might require you to use the bare workflow for compatibility.
